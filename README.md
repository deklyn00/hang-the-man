## Bugs and Improvements
- Visual bugs may occur on certain screen sizes, but they can be addressed with better use of the flexbox feature.
- Future improvements may include enhancing the game's visual design, adding sound effects, and providing more word options or difficulty levels.
- By better utilisation of flexbox and by making use of svg images being able to position the image would not only be easier, but function more efficiently than within this project.
